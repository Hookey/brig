Installation
------------

We provide pre-compiled binaries on every release. ``brig`` comes to your computer
as a single binary that includes everything you need. See here for the release list:

   https://github.com/sahib/brig/releases

Just download the binary for you platform, unpack it and put in somewhere in your
``$PATH`` (for example ``/usr/local/bin``).

If you trust us well enough, you can also use this online installer to download
the latest stable ``brig`` binary to your current working directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sahib/brig/master/scripts/install.sh)

Specific distributions
----------------------

Some distributions can install ``brig`` directly via their package manager.
Those are currently:

* Arch Linux (`PKGBUILD <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/brig-git>`_; builds ``develop`` branch)

Compiling yourself
------------------

If you use a platform we don't provide binaries for or if you want to use
a development version, you're going have to compile ``brig`` yourself. But
don't worry that's quite easy. We do not have many dependencies. You only need
two things: The programming language *Go* and the version control system
``git``.

Step 0: Installing Go
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is only required if you don't already have ``Go`` installed.
Please consult your package manager for that.

.. warning::

    ``brig`` only works with a newer version of Go (>= 1.10).
    The version in your package manager might be too outdated,
    if you're on e.g. Debian. Make sure it's rather up to date!
    If it's too old you can always use tools like ``gvm`` to get a more recent version.


If you did not do that, you gonna need to install ``Go``. `Refere here
<https://golang.org/doc/install>`_ for possible ways of doing so. Remember to
set the ``GOPATH`` environment variable to a place where you'd like to have
your ``.go`` sources being placed. For example you can put this in your
``.bashrc``:

.. code:: bash

    # Place the go sources in a "go" directory inside your home directory:
    export GOPATH=~/go
    # This is needed for the go toolchain:
    export GOBIN="$GOPATH/bin"
    # Make sure that our shell finds the go binaries:
    export PATH="$GOPATH/bin:$PATH"

By choosing to have the ``GOPATH`` in your home directory you're not required
to have ``sudo`` permissions later on. You also need to have ``git``
`installed <https://git-scm.com/download/linux>`_ for the next step.

Step 1: Compile & Install ``brig``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This step requires setting ``GOPATH``, as discussed in the previous section.

.. code:: bash

    $ go get -d -v -u github.com/sahib/brig  # Download the sources.
    $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/sahib/brig   # Go to the source directory.
    $ go run mage.go                         # Build the software.

All dependencies of brig are downloaded for you during the first step.
Execution might take a few minutes though because all of ``brig`` is being
compiled during the ``go run mage.go`` step.

If you cannot or want to install ``git`` for some reason, you can `manually
download a zip <https://github.com/sahib/brig/archive/master.zip>`_ from GitHub
and place its contents into ``$GOPATH/src/github.com/sahib/brig``. In this
case, you can skip the ``go get`` step.

Step 2: Test if the installation is working
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If everything worked, there will be a ``brig`` binary in ``$GOBIN``.

.. code:: bash

    $ brig help

If above command prints out documentation on how to use the program's
commandline switches then the installation worked. Happy file shipping!

Setting up IPFS
---------------

``brig`` requires a running *IPFS* daemon. While ``brig`` has ways to do install a IPFS daemon for you,
it is preferable to install it via your package manager or via the official way:
